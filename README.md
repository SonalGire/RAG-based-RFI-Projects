# RAG-based-RFI-Projects
RFI solutions built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation, LangChain, and GenAI.

A growing collection of AI-powered projects that solve real-world RFI (Request for Information) challenges using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built with LangChain, vector stores, and LLMs to create intelligent, document-aware systems.


## 🔍 What is this Repo?

This repository contains multiple RAG-based implementations to automate and enhance RFI processes. Each project explores different combinations of document retrieval, language models, and generation strategies to provide accurate and fast responses for domain-specific RFIs.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **LangChain** – for pipeline orchestration
- **FAISS / ChromaDB / TF-IDF** – as vector retrievers
- **Google Gemini / OpenAI GPT / Ollama** – as LLM backends
- **Python** – core development
- **Streamlit / Django / React (optional)** – for UI experiments
